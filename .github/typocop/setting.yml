# Configuration for Typocop - a GitHub Action for checking typos in pull requests

# 'excludes' section allows you to specify files and folders to exclude
# from the typo-checking process. You can list specific files or use glob
# patterns to exclude entire directories.

excludes: # Folders and files to exclude from typo checks
  # Example: Exclude a specific file (e.g., 'exclude.rb' in the 'excludes' folder)
  - excludes/exclude.rb
  # Example: Exclude all files in the 'test' folder inside the 'excludes' directory
  - excludes/test/*

# 'skips' section defines a list of words, file names, or patterns
# for which Typocop will skip checking for typos. This is useful for common
# terms or abbreviations you don't want to be flagged as typos.

skips: # Words or patterns to skip typo-checking
  - rspec
  # Example: Skip checking for the word 'elligible' (common in testing setups)
  - elligible
